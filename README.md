## Authentication Flow

1. Login Flow

   * User enters credentials on **Login page**.
   * On success, API returns a **token** → stored in `localStorage`.
   * User is redirected to **Welcome page**, which displays user details.
   * Logout clears token → user goes back to **Login page**.
   * If a protected route is accessed without a valid token → redirect to Login.

2. Signup Flow

   * New users can create an account on the **Signup page**.
   * After successful signup → redirect to **Login page**.

3. Forgot Password & Reset Flow

   * On **Forgot Password page**, user enters registered **email**.
   * API sends an **OTP** to the email.
   * User enters OTP + new password on the **Reset Password page**.
   * On success → alert message shown (*Password reset successfully*).
   * User is redirected to **Login page** to log in with new password.
